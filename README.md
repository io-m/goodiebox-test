# First steps:
- Here are both client & server
- See what files have been git ignored
    * client side Firebase config.ts file
    * Server side Firebase serviceAccount.json file
    * Example files have been provided. They just need to be filled with your unique data
- Server starts with **yarn dev** command
- Client starts with **napm start** command

## Important to keep in mind

- I did it in periods between my work
- I struggeled a little bit with the Typescript on a client side (on server side it was fine). Mostly that is due to my 'not so profficient knowledge of React'.
- I struggeled a bit with React Router (I figured out they moved to new 6. version, and my old version knowledge did not work :D but then I downgraded it down to 5. version. )
- Since I am experimenting lately with better and concise file strucutre, as well as code structure, a followed some guy on the internet about file strucutre in React.
- Lately I have started to apply CLEAN CODE principles in Golang (my first language), and I wanted it to try to implement in Typescript as well (on server side code), but I am not satisfied yet (cause Typescript is OOP language, and Golang is not completely, so it is a different approach).
- I used in memory DB (basically if you refresh the server data is lost), since in node I've been only working with ORM database clients (such as Primsa or Mongoose for NOSQL), so I did not have time to look for normal low level db connector and write plai SQL statement (f.e. INSERT INTO 'table name' VALUES (....) etc..)
